remove ANSI bottom row
resize/relocate Tsangan bottom row to be AEK
relocate parts that now overlap the new bottom row layout
re-route to the new relocated switches and other parts
find replacement parts for the few that are out of stock, and make sure there aren't more JLC extended parts than are necessary
I would personally remove the flex cut and change routing that was previously going around it
